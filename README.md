# Laptop-Price-Prediction-Model
An end-to-end laptop price prediction model is a machine learning system designed to estimate the price of laptops based on various features such as specifications, brand, age, and market trends. It encompasses the entire process from data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment. This model typically utilizes techniques such as feature engineering, regression analysis, and possibly deep learning algorithms to make accurate predictions. The goal is to provide users with an efficient and reliable tool for estimating the value of laptops in the market, aiding in decision-making processes such as buying, selling, or pricing strategies for retailers.
